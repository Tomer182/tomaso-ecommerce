## The $73 Upgrade That Sold My Apartment

When I decided to sell my apartment, a realtor told me I'd need to spend $15,000-20,000 on upgrades to be competitive.

I had $2,000.

So I got strategic. I researched which upgrades gave the best ROI. I focused on high-impact, low-cost changes. I did most of the work myself.

Total spent: $1,847.

The apartment sold in 11 days, for $18,000 over asking price.

The funny thing? The upgrade buyers mentioned most in their feedback cost me $73: new cabinet hardware in the kitchen. Seventy-three dollars. That's it.

This taught me something important: **expensive doesn't mean effective.**

Here's every home upgrade I've done that actually paid off, ranked by ROI.

## The Tier System: Where to Spend Your Money

### Tier 1: Instant Impact ($0-100 per room)
These changes take under 2 hours and make an immediate visual difference.

### Tier 2: Weekend Warriors ($100-400 per room)
These require a weekend and some basic DIY skills, but transform a space.

### Tier 3: The Investments ($400-1,000 per room)
Higher cost, but genuine long-term value. Do these only if staying 3+ years or selling soon.

Let's break down each tier.

## Tier 1: The High-Impact, Low-Cost Wins

### 1. Cabinet Hardware ($50-100)

**What:** Replace old/builder-grade handles and knobs  
**Time:** 1-2 hours  
**Difficulty:** Super easy (just a screwdriver)

**Why it works:** Old hardware screams "dated." New hardware whispers "recently updated."

**What I did:**
- Kitchen: 18 knobs + 6 handles = $73 total (Amazon)
- Bathroom: 4 knobs = $18

**Pro tip:** Measure the existing holes before buying. If they match, no drilling required—just swap.

**ROI:** Every realtor who saw my place commented on this. $91 spent, probably added $2,000-3,000 to perceived value.

### 2. Light Switch/Outlet Covers ($15-30)

**What:** Replace yellowed/paint-splattered covers with clean white ones  
**Time:** 20 minutes  
**Difficulty:** Literally just unscrewing and screwing

**Why it works:** You don't notice them until they're gross. Then you can't unsee it.

**What I bought:**
- 25-pack white outlet covers ($12)
- 10-pack white switch covers ($7)

**Impact:** Small detail, but makes everything look cleaner and maintained.

### 3. Deep Clean ($0-50 if you DIY)

**What:** Not just "tidy up"—actual deep cleaning  
**Time:** Full day  
**Difficulty:** Tedious but simple

**The checklist:**
- Baseboards (vacuum then wipe with damp cloth)
- Window tracks (old toothbrush works great)
- Light fixtures (remove and wash glass covers)
- Air vents (remove and scrub)
- Inside cabinets (remove everything, wipe down, re-organize)
- Grout (grout cleaner + brush)
- Windows (inside and out)

**Why it works:** Clean = well-maintained = valuable

**Cost:** $35 in cleaning supplies I didn't already have

**Pro tip:** Do this before any other upgrades. You might realize you don't need some of them.

### 4. Declutter + Depersonalize ($0)

**What:** Remove 50% of your stuff, especially personal items  
**Time:** 2-4 hours  
**Difficulty:** Emotionally hard, practically easy

**The rule:** If it's not functional or beautiful, it goes (into storage or donate).

**What I removed:**
- Family photos
- Fridge magnets
- Countertop appliances (only kept coffee maker out)
- Excess furniture (made rooms look bigger)
- Personal collections (books, movies, etc.)

**Why it works:** Buyers need to imagine THEIR stuff in YOUR space. Your stuff blocks that imagination.

**ROI:** Free, and arguably the highest-impact change I made.

## Tier 2: The Weekend Warriors

### 5. Paint ($150-300 per room)

**What:** Fresh paint in neutral colors  
**Time:** Weekend project  
**Difficulty:** Moderate (prep is 70% of the work)

**Colors that work:**
- Walls: Warm white/greige (not stark white)
- Trim: Bright white
- Accent wall (optional): Soft blue, sage green, charcoal

**My picks:**
- Main color: "Agreeable Gray" by Sherwin Williams
- Trim: "Pure White" by Sherwin Williams

**Why it works:** Nothing updates a space like fresh paint. Covers scuffs, brightens rooms, makes everything look newer.

**What I painted:**
- Living room: $180 (2 gallons paint + supplies)
- Bedroom: $120 (1 gallon)
- Bathroom: $90 (1 gallon)

**Total:** $390

**Pro tips:**
- Use quality paint (Sherwin Williams, Benjamin Moore)—cheap paint requires 3 coats
- Proper prep (clean, patch holes, tape) is 70% of the job
- Don't paint everything white—warm neutrals feel more expensive

**ROI:** Realtor said fresh paint probably added $5,000-8,000 to sale price.

### 6. Lighting Upgrade ($100-250 per room)

**What:** Replace builder-grade / dated fixtures  
**Time:** 2-4 hours per fixture  
**Difficulty:** Moderate (if comfortable with basic electrical)

**High-impact swaps:**
- Dining room chandelier (old brass → modern statement piece)
- Bathroom vanity lights (basic builder grade → modern 3-light fixture)
- Kitchen pendant lights (if you have an island)

**What I did:**
- Dining room: Modern geometric chandelier ($140 at Wayfair)
- Bathroom: 3-light brushed nickel vanity fixture ($75)

**Total:** $215

**Why it works:** Lighting is jewelry for your rooms. Dated lighting makes everything else look dated too.

**Pro tip:** If you're not comfortable with electrical, hire an electrician for $80-120 per fixture. Still worth it.

**ROI:** Modern lighting reads as "updated home."

### 7. Faucet Replacement ($80-200 per faucet)

**What:** Replace old/corroded kitchen and bathroom faucets  
**Time:** 1-2 hours per faucet  
**Difficulty:** Moderate (requires some under-sink work)

**What I replaced:**
- Kitchen faucet: Old chrome → Modern matte black pull-down ($140)
- Bathroom faucet: Builder brass → Brushed nickel ($75)

**Total:** $215

**Why it works:** Faucets are used daily and highly visible. New faucet = "they maintain this place."

**Pro tip:** Installation is easier than it looks. YouTube has step-by-step guides. Most don't require a plumber.

**ROI:** High visibility upgrade for relatively low cost.

### 8. Bathroom Mirror ($60-150)

**What:** Replace builder-grade medicine cabinet or basic mirror  
**Time:** 1 hour  
**Difficulty:** Easy (just mounting)

**What I did:**
- Removed basic medicine cabinet
- Installed modern round mirror ($89)
- Added a small shelf below for storage

**Why it works:** Builder mirrors are universally ugly. A nice mirror makes the whole bathroom look updated.

**Pro tip:** Measure your space first. Bigger is usually better (makes room look larger).

### 9. Window Treatments ($50-150 per window)

**What:** Replace old/broken blinds or add curtains  
**Time:** 30 min per window  
**Difficulty:** Easy

**What works:**
- Simple white or light gray curtains
- Modern roller shades
- Wood blinds (if budget allows)

**What I did:**
- Living room: Light gray linen curtains ($110 for 2 panels at Target)
- Bedroom: Blackout roller shades ($75)

**Total:** $185

**Why it works:** Windows are focal points. Nice window treatments make rooms look finished.

## Tier 3: The Investments (Only If It Makes Sense)

### 10. Backsplash ($200-600)

**What:** Add or update kitchen/bathroom backsplash  
**Time:** Weekend project  
**Difficulty:** Moderate to hard

**Options:**
- Peel-and-stick tiles (easiest, $120-200)
- Real tile (better look, $300-600 with materials)

**What I did:**
- Kitchen: White subway tile backsplash (DIY, $340 total)

**Why it works:** Huge visual impact. Makes kitchen look custom.

**ROI:** Probably added $3,000-4,000 to perceived value.

**Note:** Only do this if kitchen is otherwise decent. Don't put lipstick on a pig.

### 11. Countertop Refinishing ($200-400)

**What:** Paint/refinish dated countertops  
**Time:** Weekend project  
**Difficulty:** Moderate

**Options:**
- Countertop refinishing kit (Giani, Rust-Oleum, etc.)
- Looks like granite/marble
- Costs $70-120

**I didn't do this** (my countertops were fine), but I've seen great results.

**Why it works:** New countertops cost $2,000-5,000. Refinishing costs under $150. If done well, looks 80% as good.

**Warning:** Only works on countertops in good structural shape. Won't fix deep damage.

### 12. Closet Organization ($150-400 per closet)

**What:** Add closet system (shelves, rods, drawers)  
**Time:** Half day  
**Difficulty:** Moderate

**Options:**
- IKEA PAX system (customizable, affordable)
- Closet kit from Home Depot/Lowes
- Professional install (expensive but perfect)

**What I did:**
- Master bedroom: IKEA PAX system ($280 installed myself)

**Why it works:** "Good closet space" is a top-3 buyer priority. Organized closet = more perceived space.

**Pro tip:** Remove everything from closet before showing. Makes it look bigger.

## The Upgrades That DON'T Pay Off

I tested some upgrades that **did not** provide good ROI. Save your money:

❌ **Expensive art** - Taste is subjective. Spend $50 at most on neutral prints.

❌ **High-end appliances** (if selling soon) - Buyers don't pay extra for a $1,200 fridge vs. a $600 one.

❌ **Carpet replacement** (unless totally trashed) - Deep clean instead. Saves $1,000+.

❌ **Trendy accent walls** (bold colors/patterns) - Neutral sells better.

❌ **Over-landscaping** - Basic maintenance, yes. $2,000 in plants, no.

❌ **Smart home overkill** - One smart thermostat, sure. $5,000 in automation, buyers don't care.

Don't do everything at once. Here's the order that maximizes impact per dollar:

## Bottom Line

You don't need a massive budget to make your home look significantly better.

You need to be strategic:
1. **Focus on high-visibility items** (what people notice first)
2. **Prioritize clean and neutral** over trendy and personal
3. **DIY what you can** (saves 50-70% vs. hiring out)
4. **Don't over-improve** for your neighborhood

Whether you're selling or just want to enjoy your space more, these upgrades work.

Start with the free stuff (clean, declutter). Then layer in the small wins (hardware, paint). You'll be shocked at the transformation.

My $1,859 felt like $20,000 worth of upgrades. Because I was smart about where it went.
